 *
 * brief This component will combine all context providers into one provider so that we only need to wrap our app in one
 * provider which gets rid of the need for endless context provider nesting while still allowing us to access individual
 * providers, making it clear in our code which contexts data is coming from :] similar to redux combine reducers but better!
 *
 * reference https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/how-to-combine-context-providers-for-cleaner-react-code-9ed24f20225e
 * but modified to be compatible with React 18 woot!
